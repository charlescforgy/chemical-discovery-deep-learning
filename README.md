# chemical-discovery-deep-learning
Datasets, algorithms, and papers on the application of deep learning to the discovery of pharmaceuticals, catalysts, and other novel chemicals. 

Inspired by Robin Cole's outstanding [repo](https://github.com/satellite-image-deep-learning) `satellite-image-deep-learning`, this repo will contain three broad categories:
1. Datasets that can be used to train chemistry deep learning models
2. Collections of deep learning algorithms and links to other repos implmenting deep learning for chemical discovery
3. Papers and other useful resources
